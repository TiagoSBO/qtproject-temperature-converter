# Temperature Converter 🌡️

A Qt-based program for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with an intuitive interface and additional features like optional rounding.


## 📖About the Project
The Temperature Converter application provides a user-friendly way to perform temperature conversions between the three most common scales:

- Celsius
- Fahrenheit
- Kelvin

### Important to say
*This is my first project using a framework for some programming language and mainly implementing a GUI. It is a project entirely focused on the study of QT and C++ itself.*
